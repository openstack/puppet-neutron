    This patch introduce parameters which support SSL to connect to
    OVN_Northbound DB and OVN_Southbound DB. This can be set by:
    * 'ovn_nb_private_key': The PEM file with private key for SSL connection to OVN-NB-DB
    * 'ovn_nb_certificate': The PEM file with certificate that certifies the private
    key specified in ovn_nb_private_key
    * 'ovn_nb_ca_cert': The PEM file with CA certificate that OVN should use to
    verify certificates presented to it by SSL peers
    * 'ovn_sb_private_key': The PEM file with private key for SSL connection to OVN-SB-DBt,
    * 'ovn_sb_certificate': The PEM file with certificate that certifies the
    private key specified in ovn_sb_private_key'
    * 'ovn_sb_ca_cert': The PEM file with CA certificate that OVN should use to
    verify certificates presented to it by SSL peers
